      <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>Team name</b>: Mr. Oculus, I don't feel so good..</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>Project Topic</b>: Our topic is to explore the coding and compression techniques used for Virtual Reality (VR), speciﬁcally for VR headsets connected to a GPU. 
								Data compression and delivery for VR is very important because inconsistencies or unexpected outcomes in the video output while users move their heads can lead to negative user experience and extreme nausea.</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>What's been done already</b>: VR is an emerging industry and so there are many coding and compression techniques currently in development. 
								Very few are open source so it will be diﬃcult forus to ﬁnd speciﬁc details, but two standards that look interesting are JPEG XS and MPEG-OMAF. 
								JPEG XS is a lossless compression standard for images that focuses on low latency and minimal complexity. 
								MPEG-OMAF is a standard for storage and transmission of 360 degree video that has similar motivations to JPEG XS. 
								These compression techniques are relatively new so exploring and perhaps testing them may produce unexpected results.</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>Expected deliverables</b>: There will be a report. We likely will not be able to have a demo since these standards are still in development and the technology is not easy to get our hands on. 
								This may change as we read more about it.</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>Schedule</b>: At this point, we are continuing to search for more info on the topic each day and will read more about VR while keeping notes of what we think is important to write about in our ﬁnal report. 
								We will keep the website updated with our ﬁndings.</h5>
