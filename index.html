      <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>Team name</b>: Mr Oculus, I don't feel so good..</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>Project Topic</b>: Exploring the coding and compression techniques used for Virtual Reality. Specifically Virtual Reality headsets that are connected to a GPU.</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>What's been done already</b>: This is an emerging industry and so there are many coding and compression techniques currently in development. 
								Very few are open source so it will be difficult for us to find specific details, but two standards that look interesting are JPEG XS and MPEG-OMAF. 
								JPEG XS is a compression standard for images that focuses on low latency and minimal complexity. To achieve these goals, compression ratio is sacrificed. One of the main motivations for making this sacrifice is that people can feel nauseous when they move their head and the view they are looking at doesn't move immediately with them. 
								MPEG-OMAF is a standard for storage and transmission of 360 degree video and has similar motivations to JPEG XS.</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>Expected deliverables</b>: There will be a report. We likely won't be able to have a demo since these standards are still in development and the technology isn't easy to get our hands on.</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><b>Schedule</b>: We only have a general plan as of now. We are continuing to search for more info on the topic each day and read more and more about it while keeping notes of what we think is important to write about in our final report.</h5>
